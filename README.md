###Description
We aim to create a social media platform that will allow a social bridge to be formed between users regardless of geographic location or background. Everyone will be allowed to share their opinions equally and freely so long as they abide by general social standards and respect other users. This will a safe and encouraging environment that will promote public discussions that can be joined by anyone. Individual users will be able to follow other users should they please. This will allow them to see an active feed of their posts which they will be allowed to like to show support for. They will also be able to leave comments underneath sharing their opinion on the topic or just a general response to the post.
